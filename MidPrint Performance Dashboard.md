Best practices for integrating a Google Ads performance dashboard into Allied Advantage Ads ("MidPrint")
Understanding the existing Allied Advantage Ads stack
Frontend – Next.js & Firebase Auth – The project is a Next.js application hosted on Vercel with an onboarding flow under app/(authenticated)/onboarding that collects client data and stores it in Firestore. The frontend uses Firebase Authentication for login and uses environment variables/Secret Manager for sensitive keys.

Backend – Firebase Functions/Google Cloud – The repository contains functions/index.js with server‑side logic. It imports firebase-functions/v2 and uses onRequest handlers to provide API endpoints (e.g., handleOnboardingSubmission) and uses Secret Manager to fetch secrets and external service tokens. The functions are deployed to Google Cloud and integrated with Vercel for landing‑page deployments. Secret Manager is used for credentials such as GitHub tokens and Vercel API keys.

Deployment & logging – The Vercel deployment guide shows that landing pages are generated by cloning a GitHub template repository, deploying it to Vercel and storing metadata in Firestore. Logging is handled via console logs in the browser and Firebase Functions logs.

Google Ads API & data‑ingestion best practices
Efficient data retrieval
The Google Ads API provides detailed metrics for campaigns, ad groups and ads via GAQL queries. To avoid rate limits and high resource consumption:

Cache frequently accessed data – Google recommends caching entity details (campaign names, ad groups, etc.) in a local database instead of repeatedly calling the API. Use ChangeStatus and ChangeEvent reports to detect which entities have changed since the last sync
developers.google.com
.

Optimize report frequency – Data freshness guidelines from Google indicate that you don’t need to fetch every account frequently. Limit high‑frequency updates to top accounts and update others once or twice per day
developers.google.com
.

Fetch larger batches – Instead of making many small calls, fetch larger datasets and process them locally. For example, rather than looping through ad group IDs and running individual queries (which can cause throttling on large accounts), run a single query covering all ad groups and filter locally
developers.google.com
. If the query becomes too large, add LIMIT clauses to break it into manageable chunks
developers.google.com
.

Select only needed fields – Don’t fetch columns that update infrequently. Only metrics (e.g., clicks, impressions, cost) need frequent updates; other fields (ad text, campaign settings) can be cached and updated less often
developers.google.com
.

Understand resource usage – Google Ads API throttles queries that consume too many resources. The API returns a cost metric for each report to help monitor consumption. Running fewer, broader queries reduces the chance of hitting quotas
developers.google.com
.

Data transfer via BigQuery
Google Cloud’s BigQuery Data Transfer Service can import Google Ads data into BigQuery on a schedule. The OWOX 2025 guide summarises the steps:

Create a BigQuery dataset – In the BigQuery console create a dataset in the same region as any GA4 data
owox.com
.

Configure the transfer – In BigQuery → Data Transfers, create a new transfer; choose Google Ads as the source, set the display name, schedule (hourly/daily), dataset and Google Ads customer (or manager) ID. You can include Performance Max campaign data and customise the refresh window (default 7 days, extendable to 30)
owox.com
.

Back‑fill historical data – After the transfer is created you can manually back‑fill data for a defined date range
owox.com
.

Query the data – Once the data lands in BigQuery you can run SQL queries to calculate metrics (impressions, interactions, cost) over a date range
owox.com
.

Using BigQuery is optional for the first iteration; direct Firestore storage may suffice for simple dashboards. BigQuery becomes useful when cross‑analysing ad data with GA4 or CRM data and for long‑term historical reporting.

Scheduling and automation
Firebase Functions can be scheduled using Cloud Scheduler and Pub/Sub. The onSchedule handler creates a Pub/Sub topic that Cloud Scheduler triggers. You can set cron expressions and time zones; for example, to run a function every five minutes:

javascript
Copy
Edit
exports.scheduledFunction = functions.pubsub.schedule('every 5 minutes').onRun((context) => {
  console.log('This will be run every 5 minutes');
  return null;
});
The scheduler requires your Firebase project to be on the Blaze plan. The Pub/Sub and Cloud Scheduler APIs must be enabled, and each scheduler job costs $0.10 per month (three jobs per account are free)
firebase.google.com
. You can specify time zones using either App Engine cron syntax or Unix crontab
firebase.google.com
.

High‑level architecture for “MidPrint”
The goal of “MidPrint” is to display ad‑performance data to clients in the first iteration and later support campaign creation. The design should integrate seamlessly with the existing Next.js/Firebase stack and follow Google Ads API best practices.

1. Authentication & authorization
Client login – Reuse the current Firebase Authentication setup. The MidPrint dashboard lives under app/(authenticated)/midprint so only logged‑in users can access it.

Mapping users to Google Ads accounts – During onboarding, collect each client’s Google Ads Customer ID and link to the Allied Advantage Ads MCC (manager account).

Secrets – Store the Google Ads developer token and OAuth client credentials (client ID/secret) in Google Cloud Secret Manager. Use the existing secret‑fetching helper in functions/index.js to load these values.

2. Data ingestion layer
There are two main options for ingesting Google Ads data:

Option	Description	When to use
Direct API via scheduled Cloud Function (recommended initially)	Write a Cloud Function (Node.js or Python) that uses the Google Ads API client library and SearchStream to query metrics such as impressions, clicks, cost, conversions and CPC. Cache entity details in Firestore or a relational DB and update metrics at scheduled intervals using Cloud Scheduler. Follow Google’s guidelines to cache data and run larger queries rather than many small ones
developers.google.com
.	Suitable for a lightweight dashboard with a small number of clients. Offers more control over caching and allows incremental updates using ChangeStatus reports.
BigQuery Data Transfer Service	Configure the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to import Google Ads data automatically into BigQuery
owox.com
. Query the data using BigQuery SQL and expose aggregated results to the dashboard. Use scheduled queries or Dataflow jobs to aggregate data by date, campaign, ad group etc.	Suitable if you need to merge Google Ads data with GA4 or CRM data or support complex historical analysis. Adds a dependency on BigQuery and may incur additional cost.

For the first iteration (displaying performance metrics), the direct API approach is simpler. A scheduled Cloud Function can run GAQL queries daily (or hourly for top accounts) to fetch metrics and store them in Firestore. Use change_status reports to update cached entity details (campaign names, ad names) and avoid full refreshes
developers.google.com
. Use the query_resource_consumption returned by the API to monitor the resource cost of each report and avoid rate limits
developers.google.com
.

Sample GAQL query for campaigns:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT
  campaign.id,
  campaign.name,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.impressions,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  segments.date
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_7_DAYS
3. Storage & caching
Metrics storage – Store aggregated metrics in Firestore under a collection like midprintMetrics/{userId}/{date} with documents keyed by date and campaign ID. Each document contains metrics (clicks, impressions, cost) and a timestamp. When using BigQuery, store raw data in BigQuery and write aggregated results back to Firestore for fast dashboard access.

Entity cache – Maintain a separate campaigns and ads collection with campaign names and statuses. Update these using ChangeStatus reports to avoid repeated calls
developers.google.com
.

Reporting UI – The Next.js page fetches metrics via an internal API route (e.g., /api/midprint/{userId}) that queries Firestore and returns aggregated results. The UI can display charts (bar charts for clicks by day, cost vs conversions, etc.).

4. Scheduled refresh flow
A Cloud Scheduler job triggers a Pub/Sub topic at defined intervals (e.g., daily at 7 AM). The job calls a Cloud Function.

The Cloud Function loops through active users/clients, reads their Google Ads refresh tokens and customer IDs from Firestore or Secret Manager, and uses the Google Ads API client to fetch metrics. It uses GAQL queries that group by date and campaign and stores results in Firestore. It respects guidelines on caching and large queries
developers.google.com
.

The function logs each run in Cloud Logging and writes aggregated metrics back to Firestore/BigQuery.

If using BigQuery Data Transfer, scheduling and ingestion are handled by BigQuery. A separate scheduled query or Cloud Function can process BigQuery tables and write aggregated data to Firestore.

5. MidPrint dashboard UI
Create a new page at app/(authenticated)/midprint/page.tsx that uses server components or client components to fetch metrics from the internal API.

Display summary cards (e.g., total impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC) for the selected date range.

Provide filters for campaign and date range. Use charts for trends. Use React Query or SWR for data fetching and caching on the client side.

Ensure the page checks the user’s authentication state and shows a “Connect Google Ads” flow if the user hasn’t authorized access yet.

6. Preparing for future ad‑creation capabilities
To support campaign creation and management in future iterations:

OAuth scopes – Request additional scopes such as https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords (for managing campaigns) when obtaining user consent. Store the scopes along with the refresh token.

Batch mutations – Use the Google Ads API’s BatchJobService or Mutate methods to create campaigns, ad groups and ads efficiently. Use best practices such as bulk mutates to reduce network calls and to avoid concurrency issues (see Google’s Mutating information efficiently guide).

Validation – Provide UI forms for campaign configuration (budget, targeting, creatives). Validate data locally before sending to the API. Provide preview and confirmation screens.

Permissions – Respect account‑level restrictions. Some clients may not allow your app to create campaigns. Implement checks and handle permission errors gracefully.

Logging & auditing – Log all campaign-creation actions with user IDs and timestamps. Use Firestore or BigQuery to maintain an audit trail.

Security & operational considerations
Secret management – Continue using Google Cloud Secret Manager for all tokens (developer token, OAuth client secrets). Never embed them in source code. The helper in functions/index.js demonstrates retrieving secrets from Secret Manager at runtime.

Rate limits & quotas – Monitor the cost metric returned by the API. Spread high‑cost queries throughout the day and prioritise critical accounts
developers.google.com
. Use the recommended caching strategies to reduce API calls.

Logging & monitoring – Use Google Cloud Logging and Firestore triggers to monitor ingestion jobs. Leverage Firebase Functions logs and Cloud Monitoring alerts for error notifications.

Billing – Scheduled functions and BigQuery Data Transfer incur costs. Cloud Scheduler charges per job after the free quota
firebase.google.com
. BigQuery storage and queries also have costs; use partitioned tables and scheduled queries to control expenses.

Summary
Implementing the MidPrint dashboard involves adding a new, authenticated page to the existing Next.js/Firebase project and building a backend data‑ingestion pipeline. For the first iteration, a scheduled Cloud Function can use the Google Ads API to fetch campaign metrics for each client, cache entity details, and store aggregated metrics in Firestore. Data retrieval should follow Google’s guidelines: cache data locally, run fewer large queries, and update only frequently changing metrics
developers.google.com
. Optionally, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service can be used to import data to BigQuery for advanced reporting
owox.com
. Future iterations should expand the OAuth scopes and implement mutating functions to allow users to create and manage campaigns. Throughout, secrets should be stored in Secret Manager, and scheduling should be done through Cloud Scheduler with Pub/Sub triggers
