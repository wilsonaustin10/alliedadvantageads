## 3. Messaging Framework Execution
- **Core Promise**: “Double the performance at half the cost.”

  - Subscription skepticism: Legal contract mention, FAQ clarifications, guarantee badge.  
  - Dedicated manager availability: Limited client roster statement, case study emphasis.
- **Message Matrix (per section)**  
  - **Hero**: Headline framing 50% cost advantage; subheadline linking AI speed + lifetime pricing; CTA promise of tailored strategy.  
  - **Comparison Band**: Proof-driven copy emphasizing numerical deltas (cost, launch time); microcopy clarifying methodology; CTA to download full analysis.  
  - **AI Timeline**: Benefit statements (“Launch in 14 days vs Bateman’s 30”); AI tool callouts (predictive bidding, automated creative testing); human assurance footnotes.  
  - **Dedicated Manager**: Narrative that each client has single point of contact; value bullets (24-hour response SLA, proactive weekly reporting); outcome metric (CPL reduction).  
  - **Investor Story**: Empathy-driven headline (“Built by real estate investors for investors”); storytelling paragraph; CTA inviting personal intro.  
  - **Pricing Section**: Copy reinforcing “Price locked for life”; transparent breakdown of inclusions; cross-link to guarantee policy.  
  - **Proof Section**: Metrics-led testimonials; credibility captions (“Verified in Go High Level”); CTA to explore success library.
- **Support Asset Requirements**  
  - Gathering data: ROI case studies, comparison pricing validation, AI workflow diagrams.

  - Legal/compliance: disclaimers for performance metrics, guarantee terms accessible via tooltip and FAQ.

## 4. Visual & UX System
- **Color Strategy**: Allied blues for trust, accent gold for differentiator highlights, neutral grays for Bateman reference.  
- **Typography**: Bold modern headline font, accessible body font; consistent hierarchy for comparison data.  
- **Iconography**: Circuit motifs for AI, shield for price lock, headset/persona for dedicated manager, house outline for investor roots.  
- **Interactions**: Hover tooltips on comparison table, animated timeline transitions, testimonial carousel with pause controls.  
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile stacking order prioritized for headline + CTA, collapsible comparison table, sticky CTA shifts to bottom dock.  
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA contrast, keyboard navigable accordions, descriptive alt text, ARIA labels on CTA bar.  
- **Performance**: Next.js image optimization, lazy-loaded testimonials, prefetch comparison PDF.
- **Figma Delivery Requirements**  
  - Page-level styles: color tokens, typography styles, spacing scale, component grid (12-column desktop, 4-column mobile).  
  - Component variants: CTA buttons (primary/secondary, hover/focus/disabled), pricing cards, comparison table rows (Allied/Bateman states), testimonial cards (text/video).  
  - Annotation layer specifying spacing, responsive behavior, interaction notes.  
  - Export settings: optimized PNG/SVG for icons, WebP for hero imagery with 2x assets.
- **Comparison Table Specification**
